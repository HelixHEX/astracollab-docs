### SDK Examples

<CodeGroup>

```bash Curl
curl -X DELETE "https://api.astracollab.com/v1/files/file_1234567890abcdef" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here"
```

```javascript JavaScript SDK
import { AstraCollab } from '@astracollab/sdk';

const client = new AstraCollab('your-api-key');

// Delete single file
await client.files.delete('file_1234567890abcdef');

// Bulk delete
await client.files.bulkDelete([
  'file_1234567890abcdef',
  'file_0987654321fedcba'
]);
```

```typescript Next.js SDK
import { useDeleteFile } from '@astracollab/nextjs';

function FileList({ files }) {
  const { deleteFile, isDeleting } = useDeleteFile();

  const handleDelete = async (fileId) => {
    if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this file?')) {
      await deleteFile(fileId);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {files.map(file => (
        <div key={file.id}>
          <span>{file.name}</span>
          <button 
            onClick={() => handleDelete(file.id)}
            disabled={isDeleting}
          >
            {isDeleting ? 'Deleting...' : 'Delete'}
          </button>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Confirmation Dialog

It's recommended to show a confirmation dialog before deleting files:

```javascript
const deleteFileWithConfirmation = async (fileId, fileName) => {
  const confirmed = confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete "${fileName}"? This action cannot be undone.`);
  
  if (confirmed) {
    try {
      await deleteFile(fileId);
      console.log('File deleted successfully');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to delete file:', error);
    }
  }
};
```

### Soft Delete

Some files may be soft-deleted (moved to trash) instead of being permanently deleted. Check your organization settings for this behavior.

### Recovery

Soft-deleted files can be recovered within 30 days:

```javascript
// Recover a soft-deleted file
await client.files.recover('file_1234567890abcdef');
```

### Storage Impact

Deleting files will immediately free up storage space and reduce your usage quota.
