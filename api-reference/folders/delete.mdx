### SDK Examples

<CodeGroup>

```bash Curl
curl -X DELETE "https://api.astracollab.com/v1/folders/folder_1234567890abcdef" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here"
```

```javascript JavaScript SDK
import { AstraCollab } from '@astracollab/sdk';

const client = new AstraCollab('your-api-key');

// Delete single folder
await client.folders.delete('folder_1234567890abcdef');

// Force delete folder with contents
await client.folders.delete('folder_1234567890abcdef', {
  force: true,
  recursive: true
});

// Bulk delete
await client.folders.bulkDelete([
  'folder_1234567890abcdef',
  'folder_0987654321fedcba'
], {
  force: true
});
```

```typescript Next.js SDK
import { useDeleteFolder } from '@astracollab/nextjs';

function FolderList({ folders }) {
  const { deleteFolder, isDeleting } = useDeleteFolder();

  const handleDelete = async (folderId, folderName) => {
    const confirmed = confirm(
      `Are you sure you want to delete "${folderName}" and all its contents? This action cannot be undone.`
    );
    
    if (confirmed) {
      await deleteFolder(folderId, {
        force: true,
        recursive: true
      });
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {folders.map(folder => (
        <div key={folder.id}>
          <span>{folder.name}</span>
          <button 
            onClick={() => handleDelete(folder.id, folder.name)}
            disabled={isDeleting}
          >
            {isDeleting ? 'Deleting...' : 'Delete'}
          </button>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Confirmation Dialog

Always show a confirmation dialog before deleting folders:

```javascript
const deleteFolderWithConfirmation = async (folderId, folderName, fileCount) => {
  const message = fileCount > 0 
    ? `Are you sure you want to delete "${folderName}" and all ${fileCount} files within it? This action cannot be undone.`
    : `Are you sure you want to delete "${folderName}"? This action cannot be undone.`;
  
  const confirmed = confirm(message);
  
  if (confirmed) {
    try {
      await deleteFolder(folderId, { force: true });
      console.log('Folder deleted successfully');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to delete folder:', error);
    }
  }
};
```

### Pre-deletion Check

Check folder contents before deletion:

```javascript
const checkFolderContents = async (folderId) => {
  const folder = await client.folders.get(folderId);
  const files = await client.files.list({ folderId });
  
  return {
    folder,
    fileCount: files.length,
    totalSize: files.reduce((sum, file) => sum + file.size, 0)
  };
};
```

### Storage Impact

Deleting folders will immediately free up storage space and reduce your usage quota. The freed space is reported in the response.

### Recovery

Some folders may be soft-deleted (moved to trash) instead of being permanently deleted. Check your organization settings for this behavior.

Soft-deleted folders can be recovered within 30 days:

```javascript
// Recover a soft-deleted folder
await client.folders.recover('folder_1234567890abcdef');
```
