## API Key Authentication

All AstraCollab API endpoints require authentication using API keys. You can manage your API keys through the dashboard or via the API.

## Getting Your API Key

1. **Dashboard**: Navigate to your organization settings in the AstraCollab dashboard
2. **API Keys Section**: Go to the API Keys tab
3. **Create Key**: Click "Create API Key" and give it a descriptive name
4. **Copy Key**: Copy the generated API key (it starts with `ak_`)

<Warning>
  API keys are only shown once when created. Make sure to copy and store them securely.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all API requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.astracollab.app/v1/files" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ak_1234567890abcdef"
```

## API Key Permissions

API keys inherit the permissions of the organization they belong to:

- **Read Access**: View files, folders, and metadata
- **Write Access**: Upload, update, and delete files
- **Admin Access**: Manage API keys, billing, and organization settings

## Security Best Practices

<Note>
  Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code.
</Note>

### Do's
- Store API keys in environment variables
- Use different keys for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use the minimum required permissions

### Don'ts
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Don't share keys publicly
- Avoid using the same key across multiple applications
- Don't hardcode keys in client-side applications

## Rate Limiting

API keys are subject to rate limiting based on your plan:

- **Free Plan**: 1,000 requests per hour
- **Creator Plan**: 10,000 requests per hour
- **Studio Plan**: 50,000 requests per hour
- **Production Plan**: 100,000 requests per hour

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Error Responses

    "message": "Invalid or expired API key",
    "details": {
      "keyId": "ak_1234567890abcdef"

      "reset": 1640995200
    }
  }
}
```

## Managing API Keys

You can manage your API keys through the API:

- `GET /keys` - List all API keys
- `POST /keys` - Create a new API key
- `DELETE /keys/{keyId}` - Revoke an API key

See the [API Keys](/api-reference/keys/create) section for detailed endpoint documentation.
